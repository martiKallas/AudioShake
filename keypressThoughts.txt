GetAsyncKeyState - needs to be checked in a loop. No async for keyup
	may be able to async for keydown
	Probably fits well with plans for program listener
	may be less responsive than other options
	global (need to check but pretty sure)
WM_KEYDOWN and WM_KEYUP messages.
	don't miss any keydown or keyup events - queued
	may be better if other hot keys are involved
	may not be global
Keyboard hooks - need to be researched
	apparently difficult to implement
	global
